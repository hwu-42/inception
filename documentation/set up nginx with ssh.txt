1. install ssh, cmd:
    apt-get update && apt-get install openssl -y
2. install nginx, cmd:
    apt-get update && apt-get install nginx -y
3. produce ssh .cert and .key file, which is used to facilitate https communication, cmd:
    3.1 produce a key, cmd:
        openssl genrsa -out <name_you_choose>.key 2048
    3.2 produce a csr, this include your web information,cmd:
        openssl req -new -key test.key -out <name_you_choose>.csr
        
        Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter some information:
        Country Name (e.g., US)
        State or Province Name (e.g., California)
        Locality Name (e.g., San Francisco)
        Organization Name (e.g., My Test Org)
        Organizational Unit Name (e.g., IT)
        Common Name (e.g., localhost for local testing or a domain like example.com)
    3.3 Create a Self-Signed Certificate, cmd:
        openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in test.csr -signkey test.key -out <name_you_choose>.crt
        *after the .crt file is produced, the csr file is not useful anymore, you can delete it.
4. move the .crt and .key file to folder, /etc/nginx/ssl/, cmd:
    sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl
    sudo cp <name_you_choose>.key <name_you_choose>.crt /etc/nginx/ssl
    rm <name_you_choose>.key <name_you_choose>.crt <name_you_choose>.csr
5. config the nginx.conf file to make it work properly, the file locate at: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    refer to official web:https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/web-server/
    or find a better tutorial about how to make proper configuration of nginx.
6. test if your nginx.conf is correct, this is important, as you can see clearly which config is not correct, cmd:
    sudo nginx -t
7. restart your nginx engine, and check the status cmd:
    sudo systemctl restart nginx && systemctl status nginx
8. open a internet browser, check if it works:
    you may see info:

9. update you nginx.conf to serve different function in your website, no config, no work!

nginx default www file directory:
    /usr/share/nginx/html

** in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf comment the 2 line below, as the configuration in these files may overwrite the configuration in the /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.
    these files is also configuration for ngins servers, and basicly useful if you are serving more than one web. these file are not really necessary, you can put
    every thing into /etc/nginx/nginx.conf, but put them in different file can make the management of servers more flexible.
        include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
        include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
