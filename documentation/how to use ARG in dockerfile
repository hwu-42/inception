! ARG: defined in dockerfile will be overwrite by build: args: in docker-compose file
! build: args: in docker-compose file only overwirte ARG: defined in dockerfile, it doesn't create new build time ARG, this means
  if a ARG is not decleard in dockerfile, the build: args: do not take any effect.

how to use args arguments in docker file /docker compose file?

To use build-time arguments (ARG) in both the Dockerfile and the docker-compose.yml file, follow these steps:

1. Using ARG in the Dockerfile
In your Dockerfile, you can define build-time arguments using the ARG directive. These arguments are only available during the build process and are used to pass values to the Dockerfile for customization.

Example Dockerfile:
dockerfile
复制
编辑
# Set a build argument
ARG MY_ARG

# Use the build argument in the Dockerfile
RUN echo "The value of MY_ARG is: $MY_ARG"
2. Passing ARG via docker-compose.yml
In the docker-compose.yml file, you can pass values to the ARG defined in the Dockerfile using the build.args section. This allows you to pass different values for the argument when building the image.

Example docker-compose.yml:
yaml
复制
编辑
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: ./app  # path to your Dockerfile
      args:
        MY_ARG: "Hello from Docker Compose"
    container_name: app-container
Key Points:
The MY_ARG value is passed to the Dockerfile during the build process using the build.args directive in docker-compose.yml.
The ARG MY_ARG in the Dockerfile will use the value defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
Arguments are only available during build-time (they are not available once the container is running).
Full Example
Dockerfile:

dockerfile
复制
编辑
# Set build-time argument
ARG MY_ARG

# Use the argument to set a label or perform some action
RUN echo "Build-time argument MY_ARG: $MY_ARG"
docker-compose.yml:

yaml
复制
编辑
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: ./app  # path to your Dockerfile
      args:
        MY_ARG: "Value passed from Docker Compose"
    container_name: app-container
3. Building the Container with Docker Compose
Now, run the following command to build and start the container:

bash
复制
编辑
docker-compose up --build
The --build flag tells Docker Compose to rebuild the images before starting the containers.

4. Checking the Output
If your Dockerfile is designed to print the value of the argument, you should see the output during the build process:

csharp
复制
编辑
The value of MY_ARG is: Value passed from Docker Compose
5. Default Values for Arguments
You can also specify default values for build-time arguments in the Dockerfile using the ARG directive:

dockerfile
复制
编辑
# Define an argument with a default value
ARG MY_ARG=default_value

RUN echo "The value of MY_ARG is: $MY_ARG"
If you don’t pass the argument via docker-compose.yml, it will fall back to the default value.

Summary:
Use ARG in the Dockerfile to define build-time arguments.
Use build.args in the docker-compose.yml file to pass values to these arguments during the build process.
Arguments are only available during the build phase and are not accessible once the container is running.

environment is for service runtime args is for building, is that correct?

Yes, that's correct!

Environment Variables (env_file and environment) in docker-compose.yml are used for runtime configuration within the container. These variables are available while the container is running, allowing you to configure services with environment-specific values (like API keys, database URLs, etc.).

Build-time Arguments (build.args) in docker-compose.yml are used for building the Docker image. These arguments are available only during the image build process and are typically used to customize the image's behavior or configuration during build (e.g., setting environment-specific build flags or versions).

Summary of Differences:
Environment Variables (env_file / environment):

When to use: For runtime configuration of the container.
Where: Defined in docker-compose.yml under the services section.
Availability: Available while the container is running.
Example:

yaml
复制
编辑
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    image: my-app
    environment:
      - MY_ENV_VAR=production
    env_file:
      - .env  # You can load environment variables from a file
Build Arguments (build.args):

When to use: For build-time configuration when building the Docker image.
Where: Defined in docker-compose.yml under the build section.
Availability: Only available during the image build process (before the container starts running).
Example:

yaml
复制
编辑
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: ./app
      args:
        MY_BUILD_ARG: "some_value"
Example Breakdown:
Environment Variables: Used to configure a service once the container is up and running, such as setting credentials or enabling/disabling certain features.
Build Arguments: Used to influence the build process of the Docker image itself, like setting a version number for a package that will be installed during the image build.
To Summarize:
Environment variables = runtime configuration.
Build arguments = build-time configuration.
