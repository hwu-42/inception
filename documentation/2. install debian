1. download the ISO file of a OS, windows, mac, linux etc
    here we use debian from https://www.debian.org/, as it is free and powerful.
    here you get file: debian-xx.xx.xx-amd64-netinst.iso    e.g.:debian-12.8.0-amd64-netinst.iso   
    normmal choose amd64 ver, google if you are not sure what it is about
    netinst: means net Installation, you need to ensure the accessment to internet.

2. create a debian virtual machine, virtualbox -> Machine -> New
    2.1
        Name        : an string, any thing you want.
        Folder      : the directory where you want to store the debian image file.
        ISO Image   : the IOS file you download in the step 1.
        **for new users, don't tick "Skip Unattended Installation", it is for advanced tailorred Installation.
        next ->
    2.2
        Username    : string you like, it is for the OS user login when you start the virtual machine.
        Hostname    : the name of the pc, the name you want other to see in the LAN.
        Domain Name : it doesn't matter
        **Guest Addition, if you will share the virtual with others, create a user for him. Or you can create a user later whenever necessary
        next ->
    2.3 
        Base Memory : the RAM memory size for the virtual machine, depends on what you want to do in the virtual machine.
            **don't take all of the physical memory you have on your host, your host need some to be functional.
        Prcessors   : normmally you have more than one core in your CPU, here you allocate several to the virtual machine.
            **again, don't take all!
        **Enable EFI, don't tick it if you don't know what it is, google it.
        next->
    2.4
        Create a Virtual Hard Disk Now: it is the HDD size of the virtual machine. 
        ***Pre-allocate Full Size: recommanded to tick it, it will make the virtual machine usable no matter is your physical HDD is full or not,
            because the disk is reserved. otherwise if your HDD became full, your virtual machine will frequently fail for I/O error, 
            e.g. it try to write to HDD, but it's full.
        next->
        *USE a existing virtual hard drive file
        *Do not add a virtual hard disk
        *if you choose above 2, it means you don't need this document anymore ;)
    2.5
        last check
        Finish-> VirtualBox will create necessary virtual hardwares. then you can start the virtual machine to finish the OS Installation.
3. install OS in the virtual machine
