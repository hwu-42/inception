**here we only install docker engine only.

1. goto docke official web for debian https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/

2. follow the instruction of the web page, remove old version, if necessary. (copy the command and paste into bash terminal, press enter)

3. goto the "Install using the apt repository" part, follow the instruction step by step.
    step1 is to Set up Docker's apt repository(skip the not part, not for us).
    step2 is to Install the Docker packages.
    step3 is to test if the installation is successfull, if you see those information, congratulations, done!:

    Hello from Docker!
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

    To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
    1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
    2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
        (amd64)
    3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
        executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
    4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
        to your terminal.

    To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
    $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
