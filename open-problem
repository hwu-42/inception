1. consider to use sed to update conf files, in stead of use fixed conf, as the version of php may change we installing php via apt-get install:
  Network settings: Set listen = 0.0.0.0:9000 in www.conf for TCP socket.
  User/group settings: Ensure PHP-FPM runs under the appropriate user/group.
  Logging settings: Redirect logs to stdout or stderr for easier container log access.
  Health checks: Optional, but useful to ensure the service is running properly.
